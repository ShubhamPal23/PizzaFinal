# Understanding 
In this project I made use of Context API for transfer of data between different components\
Learned to use hooks in react\
Pizzas are loaded directly from the database as well as from a json file.\
Used various libraries, utilised MDB, MUI, custom css etc.\
Did password hashing using bcrypt for logging in and verifying user\
This also enables us to add Pizzas directly to the database.\
There is also a sign in page for users to register themselves.\


# Backend 
Backend of the project was made using ExpressJS connected to mongoDB \

# Payments 
For payments Razorpay was integerated into the web app \
Just place a valid Razorpay test key in the key field in the options of the Cart1.jsx component and you are good to go for accepting payments .

# Future Scope
Can utilise a machine learning model so that pizzas are recommended to the user based on their previous choices.\
Making UI better and more fluid
